# 🎯 What is Lightstack?

**Skip the boilerplate. Start innovating.**

We believe developers shouldn't have to rebuild the same foundation over and over again for every single project.

Lightstack is a development accelerator for the [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) ecosystem. We provide opinionated-but-flexible stacks and modules that get you from idea to working app in minutes, not days.

Perfect for launching fast and scaling confidently. Use what you need, customize extensively, and let Lightstack carry you to your first thousands of users.

## 🚀 Built for Speed

- **Development to production**: One stack, Docker Compose simplicity
- **Opinionated defaults**: Smart choices out of the box
- **Escape hatches**: Customize when you need to
