## 🚀 What is Lightstack?

Lightstack provides the missing pieces for the Nuxt ecosystem - from auth UI components to complete deployment stacks. We believe developers shouldn't have to rebuild the same infrastructure for every project.

## 📦 Our Tools

### [nuxt-starter](https://github.com/lightstack-dev/nuxt-starter)

The complete starter template with everything you need to ship

### [nuxt-auth-ui](https://github.com/lightstack-dev/nuxt-auth-ui)

Production-ready auth UI components for Nuxt + Logto

## 📄 License

All Lightstack tools are MIT licensed. Build freely!
